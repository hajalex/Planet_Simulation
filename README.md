# Planet Simulation

This is a planet simulation program using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. It simulates the motion of planets in a simple solar system based on gravitational forces.

## Features

- Simulates the motion of planets around a central star.
- Displays the planets' orbits and positions in real-time.
- Utilizes the Pygame library for graphics and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python if you don't have it installed.
2. Install the Pygame library using the command: `pip install pygame`.
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/planet-simulation.git`.
4. Navigate to the project folder: `cd planet-simulation`.
5. Run the simulation: `python main.py`.

## Usage

- Press the 'X' button to close the simulation window.
- Observe the motion of planets and their orbits.
